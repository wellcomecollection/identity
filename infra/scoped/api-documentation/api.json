Users of the API require an API key issues by Wellcome Collection, which is provided as the `X-API-Key` header. Additionally, a number of operations require a `Bearer` token in the `Authorization` header which identifies the caller. These tokens are issued as access tokens by Wellcome Collection's identity and access management platform.",
