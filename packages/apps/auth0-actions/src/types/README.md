# Actions environment type definitions

While the online editor has TypeScript definitions built in, these don't seem to be publicly available.

We have asked about this in the Auth0 forums: https://community.auth0.com/t/public-type-definitions-availability/74480.

In the mean time, each [trigger documentation page](https://auth0.com/docs/actions/triggers) contains a `Reference` section with details of the `Event` and `API` objects, which we replicate in this directory for the triggers that we're using.
